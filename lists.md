# Mailing Lists
These are various GSLUG mailing lists used for GSLUG announcements, general discussion, and organization. In addition to the lists, real-time communication takes place on Internet Relay Chat (IRC).

If you have any problems subscribing or un-subscribing from these lists, please notify Bri Hatch at mailto:bri@ifokr.org.

First...one little tidbit to prevent confusion... the aoeu.com domain is used to facilitate the hosting of these lists on Google. It is basically equivalent to the old lists.gslug.org

# Seattle Linux List (SLL)
You may also be interested in the venerable Seattle Linux List (SLL) on which many Linux topics are discussed. It is not a GSLUG list, but it is frequented by many GSLUGgers. It is hosted by SSC, the folks who publish Linux Journal.
