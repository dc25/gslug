We have been unable to find a venue for the summer months so gslug meetings are on hold.  Check the mailing lists and this site for updates.

For those who want to meet up with other linux users, other local options are :  
* [Seattle OpenSource Linux](https://www.meetup.com/seattlelinux/)
* [West Seattle Linux User Group](https://www.meetup.com/WSeaLUG/)
* [Bellevue Linux Users Group](http://belug.herber.us/index.html)
