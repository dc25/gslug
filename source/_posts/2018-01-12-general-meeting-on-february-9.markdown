If you drive, take n 92nd and turn north into the easternmost parking lot.    There is usually plenty of parking even when there is real estate class on same top floor of Education building which is west of parking.

Bus routes 40 and 26  and maybe others stop at either w side (9500 College Way N) or the south side on N 92nd of campus.

For anyone who wants to give lighting talk you can prepare USB thumb drive for use in the computer that uses wall screen, or bring your own computer and adapter cable if you don't use VGA or  HDMI.
