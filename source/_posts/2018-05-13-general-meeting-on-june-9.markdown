If you drive, take N 92nd and turn north into the easternmost parking lot.  There is usually plenty of parking.

Bus routes 40 and 26 and maybe others stop at either the west side of campus (9500 College Way N) or the south side of campus (N 92nd).

Those planning to make a presentation should either prepare a USB thumb drive, or bring their own computer.  If you bring your own computer, a VGA cable is available but if your computer does not have VGA output, make sure to bring the appropriate adapter.
