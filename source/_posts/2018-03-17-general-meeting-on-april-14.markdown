# Next GSLUG Monthly Meeting
* When: Saturday, April 14, 2018 from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM
* Where: North Seattle College, Education Building, room 1840A
* Topic: Trey Blalock, a security specialist with Verification Labs, will be giving a talk on Linux Performance Tuning that will cover a very wide range of subjects including leveraging performance tuning tools for security-related issues, responding to incidents, creating scripts to automate performance tuning, and we will discuss common mistakes people make when they approach this subject and how to prevent them. Additionally, he will be providing a walk-through of a script attendees can use to collect a wide range of performance data quickly. This discussion should be valuable for anyone approaching Linux performance tuning from an absolute beginner to an expert-level administrator.

If you drive, take N 92nd and turn north into the easternmost parking lot.  There is usually plenty of parking.

Bus routes 40 and 26 and maybe others stop at either the west side of campus (9500 College Way N) or the south side of campus (N 92nd).

Those planning to make a presentation should either prepare a USB thumb drive, or bring a computer and a VGA adapter cable if necessary.
