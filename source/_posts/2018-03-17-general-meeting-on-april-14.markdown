# Next GSLUG Monthly Meeting
* When: Saturday, April 14, 2018 from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM
* Where: North Seattle College, Education Building, room 1840A
* Topic: General Discussion

If you drive, take N 92nd and turn north into the easternmost parking lot.  There is usually plenty of parking.

Bus routes 40 and 26 and maybe others stop at either the west side of campus (9500 College Way N) or the south side of campus (N 92nd).

Those planning to make a presentation should either prepare a USB thumb drive, or bring a computer and a VGA adapter cable if necessary.
