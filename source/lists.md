# Mailing Lists
These are various GSLUG mailing lists used for GSLUG announcements, general discussion, and organization. In addition to the lists, real-time communication takes place on Internet Relay Chat (IRC).

If you have any problems subscribing or un-subscribing from these lists, please notify Bri Hatch at <mailto:bri@ifokr.org>.

First...one little tidbit to prevent confusion... the aoeu.com domain is used to facilitate the hosting of these lists on Google. It is basically equivalent to the old lists.gslug.org
