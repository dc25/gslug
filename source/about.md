# General Information
GSLUG meets every month on the 2nd Saturday from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m.

Our meetings are free to attend & open to the public. All ages are welcome. We typically have anywhere from 15-30 in attendance, ranging from beginning ("newbies") to advanced users. There is a mix of short and in-depth talks. Meetings will also be the place to hear about any upcoming GNU/Linux & Free Software-related events, announce any of your own job-related or project stuff, and of course - the infamous GSLUG Raffle!
